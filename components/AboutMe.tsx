      <p>
        I&apos;ve had an interest in technology and computer science since I got my first computer as a kid, and enjoy programming
        both professionally and as a hobby. I&apos;ve developed software for embedded, wireless and automotive 
        applications, and my recent interests include web development and machine learning.
