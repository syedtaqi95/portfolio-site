        I&apos;ve had an interest in technology and computer science since I got my first PC as a kid. I enjoy programming
        both professionally and as a hobby. I&apos;ve developed software for embedded, wireless and automotive 
        applications, and my recent interests include web development, machine learning and agile development.
